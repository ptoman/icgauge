In technical terms, price is the intersection of the supply and demand curves.  Many factors affect exactly where that intersection point lies.  For example, in periods of economic recession, demand falls sharply because people turn to less aesthetically appealing, but more functional, forms of furniture.  Many artisans are thrown out of work.  In periods of prosperity, the opposite pattern of preferences emerges.  The result may be a costly bidding war for handcrafted furniture.  However, markets usually do return to equilibrium - either as a result of shortages pushing prices up and making it more profitable for artisans to return to work or as a result of high prices forcing buyers out of the market and reducing aggregate demand.",

I was all the more touched by your kindness because since the misfortune which has struck you [the addressee's wife had died recently], since I have heard of your moving sorrow which is so like the ones I have known, you are now as close to my heart, if I may say so, as in the past you were to my mind.  I do not believe that it is a strain on you for me to speak of your bereavement again, for there is no more ridiculous custom than the one that makes you express sympathy once and for all on a given day to a person whose sorrow will endure as long as his life.  Such grief, felt in such a way is always \"present\", it is never too late to talk about it, never repetitious to mention it again.",

Some think that the elderly should give up their jobs in order to make room for the younger generation.  Such an action would bring fresh vision to business and give our society the new ideas we clearly need.  On the other hand, there are those who think that the experience of the elderly is potentially our society's deepest resource, and that their hard-won knowledge can help business to adapt to these changing times.  Of course, we rarely see either vision or wisdom in its pure form; each school of thought tends to ignore a bit of the other's perspective.",

The technological skills of the young are important if we are to keep pace with the other industrialized countries.  However, we have important social decision-making ahead of us if we are to improve our quality of life in the long term.  Thus, we must be concerned equally with developing technology as with developing a plan for its use.  It is in this latter area that the elderly, with first-hand knowledge of history, must be consulted.  With this philosophy in mind we are faced with the economic challenge of employing both young and senior citizens.",

There is no appropriate time for death; if one conceives life as a dialectic, one realizes that issues are never settled once and for all.  When every item on my list is completed a new list of items is generated.  Relationships are never fulfilled; the deeper a relationship becomes the more nurturance and care it generates.  In fact I'm not exactly in agreement with the choice points of Erikson's last stage - integrity versus despair.  While despair is certainly the negative outcome, I'm uncertain that integrity - or acceptance of one's life as \"good\" - is the desirable resolution.

        "paragraph": "There are many factors which I am not in a position to weigh.  But there does appear to be at least a possibility that a suspension of such air strikes against North Vietnam, at the right time, might provide the Hanoi authorities with an opportunity, if they wish to take it, to inject some flexibility into their policy without appearing to do so as the direct result of military pressure.  If such a suspension took place for a limited time, then the rate of incidents in South Vietnam would provide a fairly accurate way of measuring its usefulness and the desirability of continuing it.  I am not, of course, proposing any compromise on points of principle, nor any weakening of resistance to aggression in South Vietnam.  Indeed, resistance may require increased military strength to be used against the armed and attacking Communists.  I merely suggest that a measured and announced pause in one field of military action at the right time might facilitate the development of diplomatic resources which cannot easily be applied to the problem under existing circumstances.  It could, at the least, expose the intransigence of the North Vietnamese Government.",

By continuously building upon their gradually increasing assets while still maintaining the conservative lifestyles they had been pressed to follow during hard times, they created economic stability for themselves.  This economic stability, enjoyed by many approaching old age, lends greater power to seniors' increasingly vocal demands for an improved quality of life for the elderly.  Their offspring, not having faced the same hardships as their parents, have had opportunity and cause to be somewhat reflective about issues pertaining to the quality of life in general, including the plight of the elderly.",

        "paragraph": "As is the case of the many movements led by our party over the last years and more, there are always shortcomings among great achievements.  So there are always at least two ways to approach the resolution to these inherent shortcomings.  The outstanding contradiction with which we are now faced in our work is the tension and strain in various quarters caused by disproportions.  Due to the party's achievements both in development and investment, resources are finally available.  Now we must concern ourselves with the intricacies of distribution.  The development of unequal distribution has affected the social and working relationships between citified workers and their rural peasant counterparts.  The rural workers are hesitant to maintain long work hours when they perceive that the citified workers benefit more than they do themselves.  The citified workers believe that the rural life is far easier than their own and that the government farm subsidies are a waste of funds that could be better used in industrializing the cities.  Further, within the cities themselves we even have disruption among the various strata there, between merchants and workers, between land-owners and renters.  Likewise, the various strata among the peasants are at odds with one another.  This is a political problem.  The key to whether we can mobilize the broad masses to continue the great leap forward into the future that our party wishes to achieve is the extent to which we can ensure, by whatever means we now develop, the fair distribution of resources.  If we are not able to establish an equitable system, and to convince the various strata among the population that this has been achieved, hostility and competition will continue to grow.  Disproportionate distribution of resources is a problem which can be solved with a well-planned strategy, but hostility among the people is a problem which may change the entire face of our country.",

Do I assume correctly that we are, and that we want to be, civilized?  It may be that our heavy emphasis on individualism, productivity and self-sufficiency has resulted in a view of the elderly as basically useless members of society.  On a larger scale, should this opinion prevail, we could hardly have a view of ourselves as belonging to an integrated and harmonious community.  At a more specific level of intergroup relations, if this attitude flourishes, the older segment of the community may feel forced to exert their increasing economic and social power to the detriment of others in society, such as younger individuals in need of their employment positions.  This would only contribute to an adversarial relationship (albeit reversed), where resources are still not distributed with social and economic equity among a heterogeneous population.  We must all take our fair share of responsibility for the state we live in.  Our treatment of all individuals, regardless of age, depicts the state of our society; a civilized community treats all its members in a civilized manner.",
